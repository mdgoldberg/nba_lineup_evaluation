As I complete this thesis, I cannot imagine having completed it without the guidance
of my thesis advisor, Kevin Rader; I am very lucky to have had a thesis advisor who
is as interested and knowledgable in the field of sports analytics as he is.
Additionally, I sincerely thank my family, friends, and roommates, whose love and
support throughout my thesis-writing experience have kept me going.
