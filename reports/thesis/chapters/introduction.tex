\label{introduction}

Measuring a individual player's contribution to his team's success is a central
question in basketball analytics. [Explain why]

Plus/minus concept; traditionally simply point differential while on the floor (originated in hockey)

net +/- (because raw +/- could be negative but you could still be desirable because the team is less negative when you're on the floor than when you're not)

APM (takes into account all offensive and defensive players using regression)
RAPM (regularized APM)
BPM (approximation of RAPM using advanced box-score metrics)


Return to the question of an individual player's contribution to his team's success. If the reason we care about an individual's value is ultimately team success, then we should view the player's value in the context of his team; no player plays in a vaccuum.

As a coach, as a GM, etc.

context matters
